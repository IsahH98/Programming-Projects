# Tax Calculator

Here are the instructions on how to use and understand the provided code for the UK Tax Calculator using Tkinter:

1. Installation:
   - Make sure you have Tkinter installed. Tkinter is usually included with Python, so no additional installation steps are required.

2. Using the Calculator:
   - Run the script using Python.
   - The calculator window will open.
   - Enter the income amount in the "Income" entry field. Make sure to enter a valid numeric value.
   - Enter the tax year (e.g., 2022) in the "Tax Year" entry field. The tax year determines the tax rates and thresholds used for calculation.
   - Click the "Calculate" button to perform the tax calculation.
   - The tax calculation results will be displayed in the "Income Tax," "National Insurance," and "Total Tax" sections.
   - Below the tax calculation results, you will find a grid displaying a pay summary breakdown. This includes yearly, monthly, and weekly values for gross pay, tax-free allowance, total taxable amount, total tax due, and next wage.
   - If you enter invalid input (non-numeric values), an error message will be displayed in the result label.

3. Customisation:
   - The tax rates and thresholds for different tax years are defined in the `calculate_tax()` function.
   - You can add more tax years by extending the `elif` conditions in the function.
   - To customize the tax rates and thresholds for a specific tax year, modify the corresponding variables in the `elif` block for that tax year.
   - You can modify the GUI layout, labels, and styles by modifying the code in the `window` creation section.

These instructions should help you use the code and understand how the UK Tax Calculator works using Tkinter. Feel free to modify the code according to your needs and explore further customisation options.
