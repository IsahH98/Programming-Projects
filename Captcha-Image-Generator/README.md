# CAPTCHA Image Generator 

Here's an explanation of how the code works:

    1. The code imports the necessary modules for generating CAPTCHA images and creating a graphical user interface.

    2. The `generate_captcha()` function generates a random sequence of letters and numbers, creates a CAPTCHA image based on that sequence, saves the image to a file, and returns the CAPTCHA text and image path.

    3. The `check_captcha()` function compares the user's entered text with the generated CAPTCHA text and updates the result label accordingly.

    4. The `update_captcha()` function generates a new CAPTCHA, updates the image and text displayed in the GUI.

    5. The code generates an initial CAPTCHA and assigns the CAPTCHA text and image path to variables.

    6. A GUI window is created.

    7. The CAPTCHA image is displayed in the GUI.

    8. An input field is added for the user to enter their answer.

    9. A "Check CAPTCHA" button is added to compare the entered text with the generated CAPTCHA text.

    10. A result label is added to display the CAPTCHA check result.

    11. A "New CAPTCHA" button is added to generate a new CAPTCHA and update the image and text in the GUI.

    12. The GUI event loop starts, allowing user interactions and keeping the window open.

By following these steps, you can understand how the code generates and checks CAPTCHAs using a GUI.
