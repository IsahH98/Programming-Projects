## Welcome to the BMI Calculator. 

Certainly! Here are the instructions for using the provided code and converting it into a desktop application using PyInstaller:

Instructions for Using the BMI Calculator Code:
1. Make sure you have the required dependencies installed: `tkinter`, `PIL`, `webbrowser`, `messagebox`, and `openpyxl`. You can install them using the `pip` package manager.
2. Save the code in a Python file with a `.py` extension (e.g., `bmi_calculator.py`).
3. Make sure you have the `BMI_Chart.jpg` image and `bmi_records.xlsx` Excel file in the same directory as the Python file.
4. Run the code using a Python interpreter (e.g., `python bmi_calculator.py`).
5. The BMI Calculator application window will open, displaying an opening image and text.
6. Click the "BMI Calculator" button to open the BMI calculator page.
7. Enter the required information (name, age, weight, height, and date) in the input fields.
8. Click the "Calculate BMI" button to calculate the BMI and save the details to the Excel file.
9. The BMI result and category will be displayed below the "Calculate BMI" button.
10. Close the BMI calculator page when finished.

Instructions for Creating a Desktop Application using PyInstaller:
1. Install PyInstaller using the `pip` package manager: `pip install pyinstaller`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the BMI calculator code.
3. Run the PyInstaller command to create a standalone executable: `pyinstaller --onefile bmi_calculator.py`.
4. PyInstaller will analyze the code and create a bundled executable in a `dist` directory.
5. Locate the generated executable file (e.g., `bmi_calculator.exe`) in the `dist` directory.
6. Double-click the executable to run the BMI Calculator as a standalone desktop application.
7. Follow the same steps as described earlier to use the BMI Calculator functionality.

Note: When creating a standalone executable, PyInstaller packages all the required dependencies and resources within the executable itself, so the user doesn't need to have Python or the dependencies installed separately.

That's it! You now have the BMI Calculator as a desktop application that can be run on any compatible system without requiring Python or the dependencies.
